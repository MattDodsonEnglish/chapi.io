# chapi.io
CHAPI is the Credential Handler API - an open-source solution for communicating Verifiable Credentials on the Web.  The CHAPI protocol allows your digital wallet to receive Verifiable Credentails from an independent third-party issuer - or present Verifiable Credentials to an independent third-party verifier - in a way that  establishes trust and preserves privacy.

#### [Take CHAPI for a Spin](https://issuer.alpha.chapi.io)
This site provides a simple demo to show how CHAPI can enable a digital wallet to receive a Verifiable Credential from a third-party issuer.  You'll need a digital wallet for this demo - if you have one already, good for you!  If not, the CHAPI polyfill will present some suggeted options for you to try.

## CHAPI is for open for _everyone_
CHAPI is an open protocol designed to solve the "NASCAR Problem" - too often, users are presented with a fixed set of options for authentication with third-party sites.  The CHAPI protocol provides mediation between any CHAPI-enabled wallet and web application.  Just register your wallet with your browser, and off you go!

## How does CHAPI work?
Both [CHAPI](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/credential-handler-api/) and [Verifiable Credentials](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/) are results of open collaboration through World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Credentials Community Group.
